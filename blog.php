                           <p>Microsoft PowerPoint has been around since 1987 and is by far the most popular presentation tool. It is useful to present a hot new startup idea or for presenting your marketing strategies. Whether you are a newbie or a pro, here are some cool PowerPoint tips and tricks that will be handy for your next presentation.

                              <b>1. More image, less text</b> <br>
                              A picture can communicate more effectively as compared to text. Relevant and high-quality images will keep the audience engaged. Keeping words to a minimum ensures that the audience does not lose focus.

                           <p>
                           <b>2.Design matters</b><br>
                           Follow a consistent design throughout all the slides.
                            Self-designed templates and graphics, simple fonts which complement the templates will showcase a professional look. Statistics show that stock prices of those corporates are likely to increase which flush bad PowerPoint and focus on designing their stories well.<br><br>
                            
                           <b>3.No paragraphs</b><br>
                           Bulk of information presented in a paragraph format is more likely to leave your audience drained of energy. Ideally in presentations, one should keep the text in bullet format. <br>
                           6×6 Rule states that every slide must have 6 bullet points and 6 words in every bullet point.<br><br>
                            
                           <b>4.Use appropriate colors</b><br>
                           Colors evoke feelings. Using standard colors is always preferable but using the color that represents your brand is also a good idea. A perfect balance of light and dark colors gives a visually appealing look. Light background with dark text works amazing if you plan to keep lights on while presenting. Light text on a dark background works fine if you will be presenting in a dark room.<br><br>
                            
                           <b>5.Keep it simple</b><br>
                           Less is more. While making your presentation always focus on a clear message rather than cluttered with unnecessary information. Avoid over formatting at all costs. Use simple and relevant charts that are easy to understand.<br><br>

                           <b>6.Hire a design agency</b><br>
                           A professional agency will always have an upper edge in making a PowerPoint presentation that will stand out. <br>
                           At Pixel Blush Design Studio, we design super effective and functional presentations and ensure that we give you the ability to edit the content. While keeping things simple, combining appropriate fonts and colors, custom graphics, royalty-free images, relevant charts, and infographics are some of the ways.<br>
                            we always ensure that your presentation makes a greater impact among the crowd.

                           <p>At Pixel Blush Design Studio, we believe in creating designs that are unique to your brand. <br><br> 
                              While designing we keep in mind that Elements of design are different from principles of design and they should not be confused with each other. Every design consists of these elements, before creating something we go through these elements and align them with brands' requirements. These are some rules which are followed by our designers to create visually appealing art. We start with the basics and then tweak them based on our client's needs.

                     <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 right">

                           <p>
                           <b>1. Color</b><br>
                           This is the most important element. At Pixel Blush even monochromatic designs are given attention to detail while adjusting contrast and hue.<br><br>
                           Red, Green, Blue often referred to as RBG are the primary colors in the color scheme.  When we mix them we get secondary colors like orange, yellow and purple. As per your brand, we try to come up with a unique set of colors. We further categorize them into warm and cool to match the persona of your brand.<br><br>

                           <b>2. Line</b><br>
                           Line in our industry represents a connection between the two
                           points that enhances, directs, and creates movement. We often
                           use Lines to divide texts and point the direction in which you can find important information. Lines are used in infographics to guide the eye throughout the text. Keeping in mind the need of the client we play around with many types of lines from thin to thick and from vertical to horizontal.<br><br>

                           <b>3. Shape</b><br>
                           Shape is a defined area that distinguishes itself from its
                           surroundings. We put together shapes that resonate with your identity in the overall brand deck, so it is easy not just for you but also your
                           future team to understand the brand image.<br><br>

                           <b>4. Texture</b><br>
                            Textures help in conveying messages and emotions of your brand.We try to use appropriate texture  that are appealing to the eyes and complements your brands identity.<br><br>

                           <b>5. Space</b><br>
                           This is of utmost importance. The perfect balance between whitespace and imagery is very essential to portray the right
                           emotions. We use Space to provide a professional and elegant look to our design. Space is often used to separate the elements of design as well as to connect the elements of design to reveal their relationship with each other. <br><br> 

                           <b>6. Value</b><br>
                           Value in our design refers to the value of light. Without contrast, you
                           will not be able to read what is written on this screen. We use it so that it can provide the tone to the designs. We usually combine light tones and dark tones to create a visually appealing look.<br><br>
                           At Pixel Blush we help your vision to convert into reality to communicate the message.<br><br>
